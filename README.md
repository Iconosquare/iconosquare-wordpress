## Statigram Wordpress Plugin - Photo Gallery Widget

This advanced widget lets you beautifully showcase Instagram photos on your blog
or website.

* For your own photos or a #hashtag feed
* Thumbnails or slideshow
* Wide range of custom options: background and text colors, photo borders,

## Installation

Go to the download page and grab the latest version, or `git clone` the
repository if you like bleeding edge stuff. Extract everything in your Wordpress
plugins directory and enable it on your admin dashboard. You should now find a
new item in the Appearance menu called **Statigram Widget**.

Play with the settings to get the one that suits best with your blog. Then go
the Widgets menu and place where you want it to appear. You can also put it
manually with the following shortcode: `[statigram_widget]`.
