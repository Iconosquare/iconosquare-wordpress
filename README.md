# Statigram Wordpress

## Installation

Go to the download page and grab the latest version, or `git clone` the repository if you like bleeding edge stuff.
Extract everything in your Wordpress plugins directory and enable it on your admin dashboard.
You should now find a new item in the Appearance menu called **Statigram Widget**.
